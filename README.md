# MSDS Capstone: Scale Invariant Factors for Brain-Computer Interfaces 

This repository tracks the use and validation of a specialized LSTM network (Scale Invariant Temporal History (SITH)) that models the scale-invariant patterns of the brain's time cells. SITH's development was pioneered by the Computational Memory Lab at the University of Virginia; more information and code can be found here: https://github.com/compmem/SITH_Layer. Our goal is to quanitfy how well SITH can identify actions given EEG data in hopes to improve prediction accuracy of current BCI (Brain-Computer Interface) technology on EEG data by implementing neural features such as time cells as artifical agents.
