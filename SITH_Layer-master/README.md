# SITH Layer

This repo contains code for the Scale Invariant Temporal History (SITH) module for use with PyTorch. It is build on a Laplace module that performs the Laplace transform of a temporal series. Demo notebooks are provided for illustrating some of the features of the SITH module and how it can work as a drop-in replacement for a fixed Buffer or an LSTM module.
